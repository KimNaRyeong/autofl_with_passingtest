The issue could be related to how the week numbering is done across different time zones or how the date is interpreted.\n\nTo address this issue, the logic for calculating the week of the year in the `Week` constructor (`Week(Date, TimeZone, Locale)`) may need to be reviewed and potentially adjusted to ensure consistent and accurate results, especially when dealing with different time zones."
