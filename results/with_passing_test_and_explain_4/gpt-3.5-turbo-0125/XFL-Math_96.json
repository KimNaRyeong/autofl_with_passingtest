The issue may be related to how equality is determined for complex numbers in the context of this test.\n\nSince the comparison is with complex numbers, the problem could be with how complex numbers are compared for equality in the `Complex` class. It's possible that the `equals` method in the `Complex` class needs to be examined to ensure correct comparison logic. Let's proceed by retrieving the code snippet for the `equals` method in the `Complex` class.",

It uses raw bit comparison for the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers to determine equality.\n\nSince the `equals` method uses bit comparison, it might be the cause of the issue in the failing test `testMath221()`. The comparison of complex numbers in the test may not match the raw bit comparison used in the `equals` method.\n\nTo address the issue, the `equals` method in the `Complex` class may need to be updated to handle complex number equality comparisons more effectively.\n\nHere are the methods that could be fixed:\n\n```\norg.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.equals(java.lang.Object)\n```"
