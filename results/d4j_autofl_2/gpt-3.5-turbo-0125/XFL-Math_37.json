However, the test failure indicates that this is not the case. Following the execution path, we find that `StandardToolTipTagFragmentGenerator.generateToolTipFragment` is not escaping any HTML code; instead, it is using its input `toolTipText` as is. Consequently, un-escaped strings are being returned, which leads to the error demonstrated by the test.\n\nAfter providing this diagnosis, you will be prompted to suggest which methods would be the best locations to be fixed. The answers should be in the form of `ClassName.MethodName(ArgType1, ArgType2, ...)` without commentary (one per line), as your answer will be automatically processed before finally being presented to the user."

This calculation involves trigonometric functions on `real2` and `imaginary2`.\n\nGiven the calculations involved in the `tan()` method, the issue might stem from incorrect values or calculations for `real` and `imaginary` that lead to the result being `NaN`. To address the failure in the `testTan()` method, we should investigate further into how `real`, `imaginary`, `real2`, `imaginary2`, and `d` are calculated and used in the `tan()` method in the `Complex` class.\n\nLet's focus on fixing the issue in the following method:\n- `org.apache.commons.math.complex.Complex.tan()`"
